hopefully, trigger build-and-deploy by committing in this directory
apparently, saving in / (root) will trigger (not what i wanted)
... maybe i should put the pages in /mdn
somehow, the 'visit' button builds a 'site' based only on /docs/readme.md,
while the 'https://...' link finds the site built from /
